## Summary

My goal is to retrain and become a Front-End Developer. I really enjoy learning, gaining new knowledge and applying it in practice, so I am not afraid to develop in my new profession every day. I like to create something new and useful, so the most important thing in life for me is to benefit people. I am a perfectionist and I am deeply convinced that any job has to be done well.
